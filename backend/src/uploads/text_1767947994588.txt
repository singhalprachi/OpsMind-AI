Infotact Solutions - AI Innovation Lab Product Engineering 1 Infotact Solutions Confidential document To: AI Product Engineering Team (Unit Delta) From: Lead AI Architect Date: December 1, 2025 Subject: Q4 AI-Integrated SaaS Roadmap - Strategic Mandate and Technical Execution----- Strategic Mandate: The Pivot to Applied AI Team, This quarter marks a critical and deliberate pivot into Applied AI. The market has moved past novelty; clients are no longer interested in generic, surface-level chatbots or proof-of-concept AI features. They are demanding tools that deliver tangible, measurable business results by directly addressing core pain points. Our focus must be on solutions that automate revenue generation and drive immediate, quantifiable improvements in operational efficiency. The three projects selected—Knowledge Management, Marketing Automation, and Lead Generation—are not arbitrary; they are the highest-impact areas identified in our market research. Our execution will be defined by the synthesis of robust web development and advanced, production-grade AI engineering. We will leverage the familiar, reliable MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) but it will be supercharged with the best Generative AI capabilities available. This means utilizing more than just simple API wrappers; we will implement production-grade architectures including Queues (BullMQ), Vector Stores (MongoDB Atlas Vector Search), and Headless Browsers (Puppeteer) to ensure scalability, reliability, and true enterprise-readiness.-----Contents - Index 1.

Tech Stack - The Deep Architecture: Building Agentic Workflows Our development philosophy for this roadmap is centered on building sophisticated "Agentic Workflows"—systems where the AI is not just a language model but an active component that can retrieve information, generate creative assets, and execute tasks autonomously. Here is how the MERN stack is augmented: Infotact Solutions - AI Innovation Lab Product Engineering 2 Infotact Solutions Confidential document Component Technology Rationale & Use Case The Brain (LLMs) Gemini 1.5 Flash (via Google AI Studio) or Groq (Llama 3) Selected for high-speed, low- latency, and cost-effective inference. Critical for RAG synthesis and high- throughput text generation tasks (e.g., generating 100 lead summaries). The Creative (Image Gen) Hugging Face Inference API (Flux or Stable Diffusion) Provides access to state-of- the-art text-to-image models without the prohibitive cost and maintenance of massive dedicated GPU clusters. Powers the Ad Creative Generator. The Memory (Vector DB) MongoDB Atlas Vector Search A strategic choice to unify operational data (user profiles, lead lists) and semantic embeddings (SOP document chunks) in a single platform. Simplifies management, security, and query latency. The Hands (Scraping & Automation) Puppeteer with Stealth Plugin Essential for navigating modern, dynamic web applications (Google Maps, LinkedIn). The stealth plugin is non-negotiable for avoiding bot detection and ensuring data integrity for the Lead Scraper. The Orchestrator LangChain.js Provides the abstraction layer necessary to manage complex prompt chains, context retrieval, multi-step agent execution, and the integration of diverse Infotact Solutions - AI Innovation Lab Product Engineering 3 Infotact Solutions Confidential document toolsets. The Plumbing (Queues) BullMQ / Redis Manages long-running, asynchronous tasks like file ingestion (RAG) and bulk web scraping (Lead Scraper), ensuring the Node.js Express server remains responsive and fault-tolerant. The Vision (Image Manipulation) Sharp / Canvas Used for high-speed, programmatic image manipulation (e.g., compositing, resizing, and overlaying logos/CTAs onto generated ad creatives). -----2. Project 1: Enterprise SOP Neural Brain Project Title: Context-Aware Corporate Knowledge Assistant Product Brand Name: "OpsMind AI" Use Case (Production): The primary value proposition is eliminating wasted employee time. Employees currently spend hours navigating complex, siloed document folders to find answers to questions like, "How to process a refund" or "What is the policy for extended sick leave." OpsMind AI will ingest the entire corporate knowledge base (PDFs, internal documents, HR Policies), index them using a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system, and instantly provide accurate, cited answers. The defining feature is the Hallucination Guardrail: the system must explicitly state, "I don't know," if the answer cannot be found within the indexed source material. Product Features (Deep/Production): ● RAG Pipeline: A robust workflow encompassing PDF parsing, text splitting (chunking with character overlap), embedding generation, vector storage, semantic search, and LLM synthesis. ● Precision Citation Engine: The AI response must include the specific, verifiable page number and source document filename for every claim to build user trust and allow for easy verification. Infotact Solutions - AI Innovation Lab Product Engineering 4 Infotact Solutions Confidential document ● Admin Knowledge Graph: A visual dashboard component that tracks and visualizes which documents and topics are most frequently accessed or queried, providing immediate insights for knowledge base administrators. Week Goal Key Implementation Tasks Review / Success Metric Week 1 The Knowledge Ingestion Layer Build a robust file upload service (Multer). Create the core script to parse PDFs, split text into 1000-character overlapping chunks. Generate Embeddings (e.g., text-embedding-004) and store vectors in MongoDB Atlas. Verify vectors are indexed, searchable, and can be retrieved correctly via the Atlas search index. Week 2 The Retrieval Engine Core Implement the MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline using the $vectorSearch operator. Build the LangChain logic to merge the User Query + Top 3 Retrieved Chunks into a focused System Prompt for the LLM. Query "Refund Policy" and ensure the specific, relevant paragraph is retrieved as context before the final generation step. Week 3 The Chat Interface & Synthesis Integrate Gemini 1.5 Flash for low-latency generation. Implement response streaming to the React frontend using Server-Sent Events Hallucination Test: Ask a question demonstrably not in the SOP documents. The AI must refuse to answer or state lack of context. Infotact Solutions - AI Innovation Lab Product Engineering 5 Infotact Solutions Confidential document (SSE). Develop "Reference Cards" in the UI to display citations. Week 4 Optimization & Deployment Implement Chat History persistence in MongoDB to enable contextual follow-up questions. Finalize security and role- based access. Deploy the full stack to Vercel/Render. Conduct End-to-End User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with non-technical users. -----3. Project 2: AI Ad Creative Generator Project Title: Automated Social Media Campaign Studio Product Brand Name: "AdVantage Gen" Use Case (Production): Modern marketing demands rapid iteration and A/B testing. This tool automates the process of generating ad campaigns by taking a single prompt (e.g., "Eco- friendly coffee cup in a rainy cafe, focused on sustainability") and simultaneously generating the Image, writing the optimized Copy (Caption + Hashtags), and formatting the entire asset for platforms like Instagram/LinkedIn. Product Features (Deep/Production): ● Multi-Modal Generation: The system executes parallel processes—calling the Image Generation API (Hugging Face) and the Text Generation API (Gemini) concurrently to minimize latency. ● Template Overlay & Compositing: Uses Sharp or Canvas to automatically overlay the user's uploaded Brand Logo and a customizable Call to Action (e.g., "Shop Now") button onto the generated image, creating ready-to-publish assets. ● Brand Voice Tuning: The copywriting LLM utilizes advanced prompting to generate copy in selectable tones: "Witty," "Professional," "Urgent," or "Inspirational." Infotact Solutions - AI Innovation Lab Product Engineering 6 Infotact Solutions Confidential document Week Goal Key Implementation Tasks Review / Success Metric Week 1 Image Generation Engine Connect the Express backend to the Hugging Face Inference API (Flux/SDXL). Build a prompt enhancement pipeline: an LLM rewrites the user's short prompt into a highly descriptive, image-generator- optimized prompt. Successfully generate 10 visually consistent, high- quality images from simple, varied input prompts. Week 2 Copywriting & Branding Implement LLM prompt chains for generating contextual captions with platform-appropriate hashtags. Build the Sharp pipeline to composite the Generated Image + User Logo (with opacity control) + CTA badge. Verify the logo overlay is correctly scaled and positioned (e.g., bottom-right) across different output image aspect ratios (square, vertical, horizontal). Week 3 The Studio UI & Editor Build a React frontend editor using a tool like Fabric.js (or simple CSS overlays) where the user can drag, resize, and re-position the generated text and CTA elements before final export. Test the full UX Flow: Prompt -> Generate - > Edit (Move elements) -> Download. Infotact Solutions - AI Innovation Lab Product Engineering 7 Infotact Solutions Confidential document Week 4 Scaling & History Implement persistence logic to save generated campaigns (metadata, prompts, and output files to MongoDB/Cloudinary ). Develop a "Remix" feature to generate similar variants with minor prompt changes. Robust Rate Limit handling and error reporting for API quota management. -----4. Project 3: Intelligent Lead Scraper & Enrichment Engine Project Title: Domain-Specific Lead Mining Engine Product Brand Name: "ProspectMiner AI" Use Case (Production): Sales teams require highly qualified leads, not just basic contact lists. A search for "Dentists in Chicago" needs to yield more than a name and phone number; it requires verified websites, AI summaries of services, and a qualification score. ProspectMiner scrapes data from sources like Google Maps/Search, extracts data, and uses AI for website summarization and intelligent email format guessing. Product Features (Deep/Production): ● Stealth Scraping Pipeline: Utilizes Puppeteer running in a headless Chrome environment, augmented with puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth and robust User- Agent rotation to evade sophisticated bot detection mechanisms. ● AI Enrichment Layer: The core differentiator. After scraping the initial contact, the system visits the business's website, scrapes the text content, and feeds it to an LLM to categorize the business and extract key insights (e.g., "Do they offer cosmetic dentistry?"). ● Lead Scoring Logic: An AI logic model rates the lead (High/Medium/Low) based on criteria such as website quality, keyword density, and match against the user's initial query. Infotact Solutions - AI Innovation Lab Product Engineering 8 Infotact Solutions Confidential document Week Goal Key Implementation Tasks Review / Success Metric Week 1 The Scraper Core & Stealth Build the core Puppeteer script to navigate Google Maps/Search, execute a query, and scroll/paginate results. Extract foundational data (Name, Address, Website, Phone) using robust CSS selectors. Bot Detection Check: Successfully scrape a large volume (e.g., 50 results) repeatedly without being rate- limited or blocked. Week 2 Queue Management & Stability Scraping is time- intensive. Implement BullMQ (backed by Redis) to handle scraping jobs asynchronously in the background. The React Frontend must display a real-time progress bar ("Scraping 12/50..."). Submit 5 concurrent, long-running scraping jobs. Ensure server stability, job completion, and correct status reporting. Week 3 AI Enrichment Layer For every successfully scraped website, launch a second, lighter crawler to fetch the homepage text. Feed this text to the LLM to extract structured data: "Key Services," "Owner Name," and potential "Email Structure" for verification. Accuracy Check: Test the AI summary and extraction against 10 human- verified websites to ensure data fidelity. Infotact Solutions - AI Innovation Lab Product Engineering 9 Infotact Solutions Confidential document Week 4 Export & Monetization Build the crucial CSV/Excel Export feature. Develop an analytics dashboard to view and filter scraped leads. Implement a simple "Credit System" (1 Credit = 1 Lead) logic in the MongoDB database for future monetization. Final, large-scale scraping run on a highly niche domain to validate the entire pipeline. -----5. Project 4: AI Voice Agent (Bonus Internal Tool) Project Title: Inbound Call Qualifier Product Brand Name: "VoiceGate AI" Use Case (Production): As an advanced portfolio piece, we will develop a full-stack, low- latency Voice Agent. When a user clicks "Talk to Sales" on a website, the AI will initiate a human-like, spoken conversation, dynamically qualifying the lead ("What is your budget?"). Crucially, it will transcribe the conversation and automatically structure the key data points. Implementation Details: ● Stack: MERN + Deepgram (STT/TTS) or an alternative real-time API (e.g., Groq for LLM and a dedicated STT/TTS service). ● Deep Production Focus: Low Latency Pipeline Optimization is the single most important metric. The entire loop (User Speak -> STT -> LLM Processing -> TTS -> AI Speak) must be under 1 second for a natural conversation flow. ● Structured Data Extraction: The LLM is given a specific instruction to dynamically fill out a JSON form ({"name": "", "budget": "", "timeline": ""}) during the conversation, providing immediate, actionable data. Week Goal Key Implementation Tasks Week 1 Frontend Audio & Recording Setup the React application to use the Web Audio API for seamless microphone recording and streaming in the browser. Infotact Solutions - AI Innovation Lab Product Engineering 10 Infotact Solutions Confidential document Week 2 STT to LLM Integration Connect the streaming microphone input to a low- latency Speech-to-Text (STT) service and send the resulting text chunks to the LLM (Groq or Gemini) for response generation. Week 3 TTS Playback Pipeline Integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) service and connect the LLM's generated response to the TTS API, then stream the resulting audio back to the user's speaker. Week 4 Final Polish & Data Capture Implement a dynamic UI visualization (e.g., an audio visualizer) to enhance user experience. Ensure the full transcript and the final JSON structured data are saved reliably to MongoDB. -----Submission Requirements: All developed projects must be Dockerized for simplified deployment and environment consistency. Live, public-facing demos are mandatory for the OpsMind AI (RAG Agent) and the AdVantage Gen (Creative Generator). Data is the new oil. AI is the refinery.
